# Task-process-lister-and-terminate-selected-process-batch-file-script-
This .bat file (including user interface) simulates a light weight task manager, allows the user to view; running processes and terminate selected processes.   
    
To view the .bat file code; open the file in notepad (or alternatively rename .bat extension to .txt).
  
 And as with all batch (.bat) scripts; the program is run by simply opening the .bat file [i.e - .bat file is automatically executed in cmd and run as if it were a standalone program]  
   
Files in this respository;  
lightweight_task_manager.bat - the main (.bat) file of interest [includes added comments for understanding each line of the script]
  
Although it is expected that this .bat script work on various OS (at least for windows), with no errors, it has so far only been tested in windows7 and windows10 (64-bit). I am unsure if the .bat script will crash (not work) on other OS, as I have not done further research/reading into possible changes between OS in regard to used .bat script.
